# Foxhole Item API

**An API built with Asp .NET Core (.NET 6) for the sole purpose of quering information from various sources about the in-game items for the mmo game "Foxhole".**

**My Projects which use this API:**
- Foxhole Train Logistics System (Shippable Items Icons + Display Names)

**Planned Features:**
- Caching of data for better performance over multiple successive calls
- Data sources acquired from the [Foxhole Fandom Wiki](https://foxhole.fandom.com/wiki/Foxhole_Wiki), tracking versions of the game to work out which data needs to be updated/re-fetched/cached
